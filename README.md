# Authentication Demo

One very frequently asked question from my Kubernetes Microservices course is how to handle Authentication and Authorization. This repo is built to support a short series of videos I'm planning to add to that course, and hopefully further material on how Istio adds authorization to workload<->workload traffic.

Currently a work in progress, hopefully releasing videos in early March 2022.

This repo is based on the "Release 2" tag from the main repo - ie a working version of Fleetman but without the overhead of a MongoDB and tracking vehicle history.
